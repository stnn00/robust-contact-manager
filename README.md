# robust-contact-manager

A robust command-line tool for managing a contact list.

Originating from the starter script `buggy_contacts.py`, intentionally designed with flaws and incomplete logic, this project demonstrates the process of refactoring, debugging, and testing to build a robust and maintainable program.

This application allows users to:
- Add new contacts while preventing duplicate entries.
- Search for existing contacts.
- Delete contacts without triggering errors.
- Navigate through a clean, user-friendly command-line interface.
- Run automated unit tests to verify functionality.

The project now features a cleaner and more resilient design, incorporating **custom exception handling**, thorough **input validation**, and a **modular structure**, all supported by an extensive **test suite** built with the `unittest` framework.
